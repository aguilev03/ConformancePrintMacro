Conformance Print Macrro
This program makes it easier to print Certificate of Conformance sheets without the need to manually type. It allows the person to scan the barcode on the lockoffs, save the file then print without the need to edit the template. Just scan and save. It works by making a duplicate of the file and renaming it by year, month, day then minutes; it will then open the new file so the person can add the scans. The script will then automatically format the text and numbers to proper locations and print the document.

Getting Started
To get started all you  will need is to run the .bat or .py script to start the process. Follow on screen directions.
